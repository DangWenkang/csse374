# CSSE 374 - Software Design

## About the Class
This class deals with software design patterns and methods such as the Strategy and Decorator patterns.

### Coursework
For the exams / homeworks, students (including myself) would usually be given starting code and a list of requirements detailing the features / functionality that needed to be implemented. The implementation was up to each individual student but it usually involved using one of the design patterns dicussed during that week's lectures. We also had to document our design by creating / updating UML class diagrams. Lastly, all of the assignments were done individually.
